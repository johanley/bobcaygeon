Generate a star atlas designed to teach the constellations. Inspired by the Edmund Mag 5 Star Atlas.

## Edmund Mag 5 Star Atlas
Out of love and admiration for the Edmund Mag 5 Star Atlas, I've created a simple set of original charts. 
These charts are designed with a single goal: to *teach people the constellations effectively*.
The charts are *not* useful for experienced deep sky observers; the are to be used to learn the constellations.
The charts are generated from the Yale Bright Star atlas, using the Java programming language.

## PDF file
The charts, in general format, resemble those found in the Edmund Mag 5 Star Atlas (now long out of print), 
but they aren't exact copies. The chart is made of two files:
- the main body [pdf file](https://github.com/johanley/bobcaygeon/tree/master/versions), with pages 8.5 x 11
- a [cover image](https://github.com/johanley/bobcaygeon/tree/master/cover) (optional)

## Equally good for north and south
An unusual aspect of the charts: they are duplicated, first with a bias for observers in the Northern hemisphere (charts 1-6),
and then for observers in the Southern hemisphere (charts 7-12), in which the labels are printed "upside down".
I thought it would be nice to be polite to the poor folks in the southern hemisphere, who usually have to put up with a 
Northern bias.

## Tragically Hip
The charts are titled 'Bobcaygeon Constellations'. That name comes from the song [Bobcaygeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6QDjDPRF5c), by the Tragically Hip.
(If you carry a Canadian passport, you'll probably understand...)

## Options for printing
There are 3 options to print the charts:
- if you have a printer, you can print it at home, using the pdf link above.
- print at the local print shop (cost: $5-$6). Ask for 8.5 x 11, double-sided. Give them both the main file and the cover file. 
I find that a simple staple-binding works fine, and is the least expensive. A coil binding costs more. 
A slightly heavier paper than normal will remove the 'see-through' aspect of lighter paper.
- print it using [lulu.com](http://www.lulu.com/content/paperback-book/bobcaygeon-constellations/25078661), a print-on-demand service, 
where I have uploaded the files (cost: a little over $10 - shipping varies). Here, you pay for the cost of production and 
shipping; I don't make any money off of it.

## Custom versions
If you like these charts, it's possible to generate a custom version for you or your astronomy group, by changing the code.
For example, the title and cover image could be changed to suit your taste, with minimal effort, if you know how to program.
You could then use such charts when interacting with the general public, for example.

If you don't know how to program, and you would like a custom version, send me a request through github, and I'll see what I can do.
